# Unit 21: You sure can attract a crowd!

Your company has decided to crowdsale their PupperCoin token in order to help fund the network development.
This network will be used to track the dog breeding activity across the globe in a decentralized way, and allow humans to track the genetic trail of their pets. You have already worked with the necessary legal bodies and have the green light on creating a crowdsale open to the public. However, you are required to enable refunds if the crowdsale is successful and the goal is met, and you are only allowed to raise a maximum of 300 Ether. The crowdsale will run for 24 weeks.

This crowdsale contract will manage the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).
This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

#### PupperCoinCrowdsale

Since `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` inherits the `RefundableCrowdsale` contract, which requires a `goal` parameter, you must call the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor from your `PupperCoinCrowdsale` constructor as well as the others. `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` does not have its own constructor, so just use the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor that it inherits.

If you forget to call the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor, the `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` will fail since it relies on it (it inherits from `RefundableCrowdsale`), and does not have its own constructor.

When passing the `open` and `close` times, use `now` and `now + 24 weeks` to set the times properly from your `PupperCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract.

#### PupperCoinCrowdsaleDeployer

In this contract, you will model the deployment based off of the `ArcadeTokenCrowdsaleDeployer` you built previously. Leverage the [OpenZeppelin Crowdsale Documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/crowdsales) for an example of a contract deploying another, as well as the starter code provided in [Crowdsale.sol](../Starter-Code/Crowdsale.sol).

### Deploying the Crowdsale

Deploy the crowdsale to the Kovan or Ropsten testnet, and store the deployed address for later. Switch MetaMask to your desired network, and use the `Deploy` tab in Remix to deploy your contracts. Take note of the total gas cost, and compare it to how costly it would be in reality. Since you are deploying to a network that you don't have control over, faucets will not likely give out 300 test Ether. You can simply reduce the goal when deploying to a testnet to an amount much smaller, like 10,000 wei.

### Submission

Create a Github repo, and a `README.md` file explaining the process for purchasing PupperCoin (or whatever name you came up with).

Also, please provide screenshots to illustrate the functionality (e.g. how you send Ether to the contract, how you add the token to MyCrypto and test a transaction, and how you test the time functionality etc.). Alternatively, you can also record your interactions with the contract as a gif (e.g. https://www.screentogif.com/)


Ensure that anyone can run the steps and add the token to MyCrypto, or a similar wallet.

Include information such as the token parameters, token name, crowdsale cap, etc.
